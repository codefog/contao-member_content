Member Content is an extension for the [Contao Open Source CMS](https://contao.org).

This extension allows you to assign content elements to individual front end members via the "Members" module. A dedicated front end module is available to display this content on the website â€” visible only to the currently logged-in user. 
This enables personalized content delivery for registered users.
